//! Shared VTA request / reply types for the online provisioning workflow.
//!
//! Three intents are supported:
//!
//! - [`VtaIntent::FullSetup`] — the VTA mints the integration's DID via a
//!   template render, rolls over an admin DID, and returns a
//!   [`super::result::ProvisionResult`] with keys, `did.jsonl`,
//!   authorization VC, and VTA trust bundle.
//! - [`VtaIntent::AdminOnly`] — the integration brings its own DID; the
//!   VTA only issues an admin credential and an ACL row. The setup DID
//!   *is* the long-term admin DID — no rotation. The reply carries an
//!   admin DID + matching private key.
//! - [`VtaIntent::AdminRotated`] — the integration brings its own
//!   integration DID **and** wants the admin DID rotated to a fresh
//!   VTA-minted identity. Same wire flow as `FullSetup` minus the
//!   integration mint. The setup DID authenticates the bootstrap and
//!   loses its authority at the end of the round-trip; the rotated
//!   admin DID becomes the long-term credential. The reply shape
//!   mirrors `AdminOnly` (admin DID + private key), just with a
//!   different DID.
//!
//! Each intent produces a [`VtaReply`] that downstream consumers handle
//! uniformly. The runners in this module produce these replies; the
//! consumer's UI / persistence layer consumes them.
//!
//! Offline / sealed-handoff variants are out of scope for this module —
//! see the workspace `vta bootstrap` CLI for that flow.
