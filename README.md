A Rust workspace implementing the two service backends of the
[First Person Network](https://www.firstperson.network/white-paper):

- **Verifiable Trust Agent (VTA)** — manages cryptographic keys, DIDs,
  and access-control policies for a single organisational identity.
- **Verifiable Trust Community (VTC)** — manages a community of
  members, their credentials, the policies that gate them, and the
  optional public website + admin UX.

Plus the CLIs, SDKs, and shared crates that compose them.

## Which service do you need?

    keys -- "yes, only keys" --> vta
    keys -- "yes, plus a community" --> pair
    keys -- "no, just a community" --> pair
    pair --> vtc

    class vta vta
    class vtc,pair vtc
```

A VTC always sits **on top of** a VTA: the VTA mints the VTC's
keys at first boot via the `vtc-host` DID template (`vtc setup`
drives the provision-integration flow against the VTA). One VTA can
host many VTCs.

Dependencies flow strictly downward — no cycles.

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| **vti-common** | Shared foundation: JWT auth, ACL, `Store`/`KeyspaceHandle`, error types, config, telemetry sink, audit envelopes. |
| **vta-sdk** | Public SDK: types, REST + DIDComm client, sealed-transfer, DID-template engine, attestation verification. |
| **vta-cli-common** | Shared CLI command implementations used by both `pnm` and `cnm`. |
| **vta-service** | VTA library + local/dev binary (`vta`). Routes, operations, setup wizards, DIDComm protocol management. |
| **vta-enclave** | VTA binary for AWS Nitro Enclaves (TEE bootstrap, KMS, vsock-store, attestation). Linux-only. |
| **vtc-service** | VTC binary (`vtc`) — community lifecycle, policies, credentials, public website, admin UX. |
| **pnm-cli** | Personal Network Manager — single-VTA operator CLI (`pnm`). |
| **cnm-cli** | Community Network Manager — multi-community operator CLI (`cnm`). |
| **didcomm-test** | Standalone DIDComm connectivity test harness. Not published. |

## Quick start

**Build the workspace:**

```sh
cargo build --workspace
```

**Pick a path:**

| If you need… | Start at |
|---|---|
| A new VTA from scratch | [`docs/02-vta/cold-start.md`](docs/02-vta/cold-start.md) |
| A VTA inside a Nitro Enclave | [`docs/02-vta/tee-architecture.md`](docs/02-vta/tee-architecture.md) |
| A new VTC on an existing VTA | [`docs/03-vtc/getting-started.md`](docs/03-vtc/getting-started.md) |
| To integrate an app against a VTA | [`docs/02-vta/integration-guide.md`](docs/02-vta/integration-guide.md) |
| To understand the architecture | [`docs/01-concepts/overview.md`](docs/01-concepts/overview.md) |

## Documentation

The documentation tree is split by audience:

- **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** — full index with topic search.
- **[docs/01-concepts/](docs/01-concepts/)** — shared concepts that
  apply to both VTA and VTC (overview, architecture, security model,
  sealed-transfer).
- **[docs/02-vta/](docs/02-vta/)** — VTA operator + integrator
  documentation (cold-start, secret backends, TEE deployment, DIDComm,
  provision-integration, runtime service management).
- **[docs/03-vtc/](docs/03-vtc/)** — VTC operator + integrator
  documentation (getting started, community lifecycle, credentials,
  trust-registry, website, admin UX).
- **[docs/04-reference/](docs/04-reference/)** — reference material
  (BIP-32 paths, CLI conventions).
- **[docs/05-design-notes/](docs/05-design-notes/)** — design
  history and implementation notes (including the VTC MVP spec).
- **[First Person Project White Paper](https://www.firstperson.network/white-paper)**
  — the broader research context.
