# Guard against the "edited a published crate's source but forgot to bump its
# version" trap that kept the Publish job red on main.
#
# What happened: vti-common's source gained `Session::last_seen` /
# `acr_expires_at`, `resolve_did_session`, `Claims::with_jti` and a new
# `mint_access_token` arity, but its version stayed at 0.11.2 — which was
# already on crates.io. The publish workflow skips any crate whose version is
# already published ("already on crates.io — skipping"), so the registry kept
# the PRE-change 0.11.2 source. vta-service was then published at a fresh
# version, and `cargo publish`'s registry-resolved verify build (which ignores
# the workspace's path deps) compiled it against that stale vti-common and hit
# E0432/E0050/E0560/E0609/E0599 — blocking the whole release. The local
# path-dep workspace build was green the entire time, so nothing caught it
# pre-merge. vtc-service had drifted the same way.
#
# This guard runs on PRs: for every PUBLISHABLE workspace crate whose *source*
# changed between the base ref and HEAD, it requires the crate's Cargo.toml
# `version` to differ from the base ref's version. Forcing a bump alongside any
# source edit means main never accumulates an unpublished source delta against a
# stale crates.io version — the release pipeline then publishes the new source
# at a fresh version and the registry never goes incompatible.
#
# "Source" = anything under the crate dir EXCEPT tests/, benches/, examples/,
# *.md and CHANGELOG* (test-/doc-only changes get no bump, per repo convention).
# `publish = false` crates are skipped — they never reach crates.io, so a stale
# registry source is impossible for them.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-version-bumps.sh [BASE_REF]   (default: origin/main)
# Portable to macOS bash 3.2 / BSD userland.
