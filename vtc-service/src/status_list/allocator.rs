//! Random-with-decoys slot allocator + bit-flip helpers.
//!
//! Spec §6.2 requires:
//!
//! - **Random allocation** so the slot index can't be
//!   correlated with credential issuance order.
//! - **Decoys** flipped on unassigned slots so external
//!   verifiers can't infer occupancy from the bitstring's
//!   Hamming weight.
//! - **Flipped indices never reallocated** so a departing
//!   member's slot index can't be reused to correlate the
//!   new holder with the departed one.
//!
//! The allocator works against a [`StatusListState`] passed by
//! `&mut`: the caller is responsible for persisting the row
//! after a mutation (the storage layer doesn't auto-write on
//! every operation; that's the route handler's job, ideally
//! inside the same fjall transaction as the credential row).
//!
//! Allocation uses a uniform RNG over the unassigned-slot index
//! list (same approach `affinidi-status-list`'s
//! `BitstringStatusList::allocate_index` uses, but we own the
//! `assigned` mask so we can persist it across daemon
//! restarts).
